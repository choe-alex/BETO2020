Highlights•50 ppm of AMP had marginal effect on the corrosion of X80 steel.•Corrosion rate was decreased as the AMP concentration increased further.•Flow was found to accelerate the propagation of pits.•The combination of PZ and AMP could not inhibit pitting corrosion efficiently.•AMP-PZ inhibited corrosion owing to both neutralization and adsorption effects.AbstractThe corrosion of steels in the supercritical CO2 environment with impurities in a carbon capture, utilization and storage system has attracted great interests in recent years. In this work, corrosion inhibition mechanisms of the residual 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and piperazine from the CO2 capture process on X80 steel within an impure supercritical CO2 environment were investigated by weight-loss method and surface analysis techniques. The results showed that a small amount of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol had marginal effect on the corrosion of steel. Corrosion rate was decreased as the 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol concentration increased further. When 100 ppm 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol + 50 ppm piperazine was added, a lowest corrosion rate was observed, reaching 0.41mm/a. Meanwhile, pitting corrosion was observed under all conditions. The combination of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and piperazine cannot inhibit pitting corrosion efficiently, while flow accelerated the propagation of pits in the presence of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol. FeSO4 was confirmed as the corrosion product for all conditions. RNH3+, PZH+, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 were detected in the corrosion products depending on the test conditions. The results indicated that the inhibition mechanism of piperazine and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol was attributed to both the neutralization and adsorption effects on the steel surface. A non-uniform adsorption inhibition mechanism is proposed based on these test results.
AbstractThe synergism of imidazole (IMZ) and poly(ethylene glycol) 600 (PEG) for zinc corrosion inhibition in 3 mol L−1 KOH solution was investigated using a combination of electrochemical and gravimetric methods, and the surface morphology of the zinc was observed by scanning electron microscopy. It is found that there is a synergistic effect between IMZ and PEG for the zinc corrosion inhibition. The difference in molecular structure, ring for IMZ and chain for PEG, and in binding atoms with zinc, nitrogen in IMZ and oxygen in PEG, contributes to this synergistic effect. IMZ inhibits zinc corrosion by mainly depressing the anodic reaction, whereas PEG by depressing the cathodic reaction. The storage performance of the zinc–manganese dioxide batteries using IMZ and/or PEG as inhibitors was determined by discharge test, with a comparison of the battery using mercury as the inhibitor. The battery containing 0.05% IMZ + 0.05% PEG exhibits better performance than the mercury-containing battery, especially when discharged at high rate.Highlights► An kind of environmentally benign organic composite additives is used firstly. ► The corrosion of zinc is inhibited used the organic compound as additive. ► The rate performance of the battery used the organic compound as additive is improved. ► The synergism of composite additives for zinc corrosion inhibition is investigated.
AbstractCorrosion inhibition of carbon steel in hydrochloric acid solution was inspected using newly Benzylidene-aniline derivatives namely: (E)-N(2-Chlorobenzylidene)-2-Fluorobenzenamine (NCF) and (E)-N(2-Chlorobenzylidene)-3-Chloro-2-Methylbenzenamine (NCCM), by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The experimental results showed that both NCF and NCCM are good inhibitors for carbon steel in 1 M HCl. The inhibition efficiency increases with inhibitors concentration rise, reaching a value up to 89.72% at 10−3 M for the inhibitor NCF. Electrochemical impedance data show a frequency distribution of the capacitance, simulated as constant phase element (CPE). Polarization curves study revealed that both inhibitors are mixed type. The adsorption on the carbon steel surface follows Langmuir isotherm model with negative values of ΔGads0<math><mrow is="true"><mi mathvariant="normal" is="true">Δ</mi><msubsup is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">G</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi mathvariant="italic" is="true">ads</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mn is="true">0</mn></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>. Thermodynamics data for the adsorption process are calculated and discussed. The effect of molecular structure on inhibition efficiency was investigated by quantum chemical calculations using density function theory (DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulation technique incorporating molecular mechanics and molecular dynamic was applied to search for the best configurationally space for (NCCM or NCF)/100H2O/α-Fe2O3 (1 1 1) systems. The results indicate that the adsorption energy of NCF was greater than NCCM which is in accordance with the experimentally determined inhibition efficiency.
AbstractThe efficiency of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), as corrosion inhibitors for steel in de-aerated 0.3 M HCl, 0.1 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M H2SO4 + 1.0 × 10−3 M HCl solutions have been determined by electrochemical studies. It was found that the HMTA acts a good corrosion inhibitor for steel corrosion in acids solutions. Increase in inhibition efficiency with the increase of concentrations of HMTA shows that inhibition actions are due to adsorption on the steel surface and adsorption follows the Langmuir isotherm. From the adsorption isotherms values of equilibrium constant (Kads), values of free energies of adsorption (ΔGads°<math><mrow is="true"><mstyle mathvariant="normal" is="true"><mi is="true">Δ</mi></mstyle><msub is="true"><mi is="true">G</mi><mrow is="true"><mtext is="true">ads</mtext></mrow></msub><mo is="true">°</mo></mrow></math>), were calculated. The effect of temperature on the corrosion behaviour in the presence of 1.0 × 10−1 M inhibitors was studied in the temperature range of 293–323 K. The inhibition efficiency of HMTA increased with increasing temperature up to 323 K. Activation energies (Ea*<math><mrow is="true"><msubsup is="true"><mi is="true">E</mi><mtext is="true">a</mtext><mo is="true">*</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>) were calculated from the obtained corrosion rates at different temperatures. Results obtained from both potentiodynamic polarisation and AC impedance measurements reveal that the compound is an effective inhibitor for the corrosion of steel and behave better in HCl than in H2SO4. Surface analyses were also carried out to establish the mechanism of corrosion inhibition of steel in acidic media.
AbstractA simple sol-gel technique for the preparation of methyl–modified silica coatings for the protection of the external surface of copper has been used in this study. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) has been used as a precursor to prepare nanosilica coatings on the surface of copper. The methyl–modified silica sols were obtained by mixing of 3% SiO2 sol solution with trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) or hexamethyldisilozane (HMDS) as basic materials. For comparison, the copper substrates were also coated with commercial polymers (Paraloid B 72, Plexisol P 550-40 and polyvinyl butyral (PVB)). The surface morphology changes of uncoated and coated specimens were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The hydrophobicity of surfaces and photochemical ageing effects were evaluated by contact angle measurements. Potentiodynamic measurements were obtained in order to compare corrosion parameters of the coatings.
Highlights•Watermelon rind extracts inhibited mild steel corrosion in HCl and H2SO4 solutions.•The adsorption of WMRE follow Temkin isotherm model.•The extracts behave as a mixed-type inhibitor in both media.•Results from all the methods are in reasonable agreement.•WMRE is a better inhibitor in HCl than in H2SO4 solution.AbstractElectrochemical techniques were used to investigate the efficacy of watermelon rind extract (WMRE) as corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in HCl and H2SO4 solutions. The inhibition efficiency increased as the concentration of the extract increases. Potentiodynamic polarization results indicate that WMRE act as a mixed-type inhibitor. The values of effective capacitance obtained by utilizing the impedance parameters in both acidic media are in the range of double layer capacitance. Corrosion inhibition effect of WMRE can be attributed to the adsorption of constituents of WMRE onto the mild steel surface which can be approximated by Temkin adsorption isotherm model.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image
Highlights•It matters where an alkoxysilane is attached to a BPA-Epoxide.•Attachment onto the secondary hydroxide group in the repeat unit appears to diminish the overall crosslink density.•The Alkoxylsilane modified at the amine position of the BPA Epoxide showed better corrosion resistance.AbstractBisphenol A (BPA) epoxy was modified with amine functionalized silane (ASE) and isocyanate functionalized silane (ISE), and the modified epoxides were blended with both tetraethyl orthosilicate oligomers (TEOS oligomers) and titanium dioxide (TiO2). These hybrid networks were characterized by solid state 29Si-NMR, contact angle, crosslink density, pull-off adhesions, and crosshatch adhesion. Corrosion resistance was examined with a salt spray test, a filiform test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Modified epoxides with addition of TEOS oligomer and TiO2 fillers showed improvement in mechanical properties. The broader degree of cross-linkage was observed in ISE based coatings. In contrast, ASE based coatings had a more uniform crosslink distribution and higher crosslink density. The addition of TiO2 fillers increase the percolation root of ISE epoxide, but was eliminated after blending with TEOS oligomer. With TEOS oligomer addition, crosslinked ISE showed complete condensation and high pull-off adhesion (153 lb/in2). The more homogeneous and higher crosslinked polymer matrix of ASE resulted in a higher diffusion resistance, and as a consequence exhibits good barrier protection under long term immersion conditions compared with the lower cross-linked ISE epoxide.
AbstractThe synthesized cationic surfactant N-(2-(2-mercaptoacetoxy) ethyl)-N,N-dimethyldodecan-1-aminium bromide (QSH) was used to prepare colloidal copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) in water through the chemical reduction method. The obtained copper nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR spectrum and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The corrosion performance was evaluated using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in addition to the salt spray test. The results obtained from these methods were in good agreement. Results showed that the modified coating provide a good coverage and an additional corrosion protection of the carbon steel.
Highlights•α-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3/Cr2O3 tritium permeation barriers can be prepared by the metal organic decomposition (MOD) method.•The nanohardness and corrossion resistance of α-Al2O3 MOD coatings are improved by a Cr2O3 buffer.•An Al2O3 MOD single layer tends to perform lower deuterium permeability at higher temperature.AbstractFour kinds of well-crystallized tritium permeation barrier coatings, including γ-Al2O3, α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3/Cr2O3 and α-Al2O3/Cr2O3, were prepared by the metal organic decomposition (MOD) method using a dipping technique. In this study, we concentrated on the preparation and properties of α-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3/Cr2O3 double-layer coatings. The results showed that the α-Al2O3 coating exhibited a pure phase structure, which was entirely and directly transformed from the γ-Al2O3 at an annealing temperature of 1000 °C, and no obvious substrate oxides were formed. An unannealed Cr2O3 MOD layer with a thickness of 0.8 μm featured higher crystallization and was taken as a buffer layer. However, the template effect of Cr2O3 was not obvious because the formation temperature of the α-Al2O3 did not decrease. The corrosion resistance (1.068 × 10−7 A/cm2) and nanohardness (18.49 GPa) of the α-Al2O3/Cr2O3 double-layer coating improved compared to those of γ-Al2O3, α-Al2O3, and γ-Al2O3/Cr2O3 coatings. In contrast, the deuterium permeation test showed that the α-Al2O3 MOD coating had the lowest deuterium ion current at temperatures of 400 ˜ 600 °C of the films considered in this study, demonstrating better resistance to deuterium permeation. Relevant mechanisms and explanations are discussed in detail.
AbstractLaboratory investigations were performed in order to assess the effectiveness and the inhibition mechanism of an amino alcohol-based inhibitor currently used as admixture to prevent corrosion of steel in concrete. The investigation was performed in the presence of chloride ions, using solutions simulating the concrete interstitial solution. Electrochemical measurements allowed to conclude that, an inhibitor film is formed on the surface hindering the anodic activity. Furthermore, the analytical investigation through the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the inhibitor film is able to complex with the chloride ion.
AbstractIn this study, a protective film consisting of an ultrathin two-dimensional polymer was prepared by hydrolysis of a (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (ethanol, 10−3 M) self-assembled monolayer grafted onto copper and a subsequent modification with 3(heptofluoroisopropoxy)propyltrichlorosilane (toluene, 10−3 M). Each stage of the preparation was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) while copper's corrosion-inhibitive properties were assessed by cyclic voltammetry measurements carried on in a 0.1 M NaOH medium. A remarkable enhancement of the copper's corrosion protection was obtained by the formation of lateral siloxane linkages between MPTS molecules absorbed followed by the grafting of the second molecular layer.
Highlights•Pyr1-1 is a good mixed-type inhibitor for steel in H2SO4 solution.•Inhibition results from surface geometric blocking by chemisorbed species.•Maximal inhibition efficiency is 93.5% at 298 K with 1.0 mM of bipyrazole derivative.•The studied bipyrazole resists to corrosion efficiently even at higher temperature.Abstract2-[Bis-(3,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-1-ylmethyl)-amino]-4-[bis-(3,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-1-ylmethyl) carbamoyl]-butyric acid (Pyr1-1) has been evaluated as a corrosion inhibitor for carbon steel using weight loss and electrochemical polarization (EIS). The study was also complemented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantum chemical calculations. The inhibition efficiency (η%) increased with increasing Pyr1-1 concentration, showing a maximum IE of 93.5% at 298 K at 10−3 M and decreased with increasing temperature. The electrochemical studies showed that Pyr1-1 inhibitor retards both cathodic and anodic processes through the inhibitor adsorption on the metal surface and blocking the active corrosion sites. The corrosion current density is the order 165.8 μA/cm2 of Pyr1-1 at the optimum concentration. EIS results show that the change in the impedance parameters (Rct and Cdl) with concentration of Pyr1-1 is indicative of the adsorption of molecules leading to the formation of a protective layer on the surface of carbon steel. A good fit to Langmuir adsorption isotherm was obtained between surface coverage degree and inhibitor concentration. The results obtained by weight loss measurements are consistent with the results of the electrochemical study. Quantum chemical approach used to calculate electronic properties of the molecule to ascertain the relation between inhibitive effect and molecular structure. The equilibrium adsorption behavior of this molecule on Fe (1 1 0) surface was investigated using molecular dynamics simulation.
Highlights•Lagerstroemia speciosa leaf extract (LSLE), as an effective environmental-friendly corrosion inhibitor in acidic medium•The inhibition efficiency of Lagerstroemia speciosa leaf extract reached 94.4% at 500 ppm in 1 M HCl at 333 K.•Lagerstroemia speciosa leaf extract behaved as a mixed type of inhibitor with predominantly anodic nature.•The adsorption of Lagerstroemia speciosa leaf extract on surface of mild steel obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm.AbstractLagerstroemia speciosa leaf extract (LSLE) was examined as corrosion mitigating agent against mild steel in 1 M HCl. The extract was characterized by GC–MS and FTIR. Weight loss (WL), potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), SEM- EDX, AFM, UV–Vis spectroscopy and DFT studies were performed to examine corrosion mitigation performance of LSLE. As revealed by WL the extract was above 94% efficient at the concentration of 500 ppm and 333 K. Adsorption of LSLE on mild steel surface is spontaneous and follows Langmuir isotherm model. Mixed type inhibition with anodic predominance was revealed by PDP results. EIS data revealed the formation of inhibitive film on metal surface by the active groups of the extract. SEM and AFM show a better morphological image and reduced surface roughness in the presence of LSLE. UV–Vis results indicate Fe-LSLE complex formation during corrosion reaction. DFT has been conducted to correlate the inhibition efficiency with the molecular structure of active species present in the extract. Quantum parameters and Molecular dynamic simulation helps in correlating the molecular structure and adsorption strength with inhibition efficiency. ANOVA statistical test was conducted to compare the inhibition efficiencies obtained by using different techniques and the data reveals that they are significantly not different.
Highlights•Corrosion inhibition efficacy of two quinoline derivatives is examined.•The inhibition efficiencies are highly satisfactory at concentrations of 25 ppm.•Obtained mixed type inhibitors obeying the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.•DFT calculated parameters are accord well with the experimental properties.•SEM measurements were applied to study the morphology of the MS surface.AbstractConventional weight loss, electrochemical measurements, quantum chemical calculations and scanning electron microscopy techniques were employed to investigate the inhibitive effects of two novel quinoline derivatives, 2-mercaptoquinoline-3-carbaldehyde and (Z)-3-((4-chlorophenylimino)methyl)quinoline-2-thiol on the corrosion of mild steel in 1 M HCl solutions. The decrease in the weight losses of mild steel samples has proved that both the additives were efficient inhibitors. The mixed mode of inhibition was confirmed by electrochemical polarizations. Both the inhibitors followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. In addition to this, the quantum chemical calculations were performed at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to complement the experimental results.Graphical abstractConventional weight loss, electrochemical measurements, quantum chemical calculations and scanning electron microscopy techniques were employed to investigate the inhibitive effects of two novel quinoline derivatives, 2-mercaptoquinoline-3-carbaldehyde and (Z)-3-((4-chlorophenylimino)methyl)quinoline-2-thiol on the corrosion of mild steel in 1 M HCl solutions.Download full-size image
Highlights•Understanding corrosion mechanisms of 3D MID metal trace in sweat environment•Better corrosion resistance of EN coating than Cu in sweat•Improved corrosion resistance of 3D MID by using SAM and hydrophobic conformal coatingAbstract3D circuitry on moulded interconnect device (MID) is usually made of multi-layered metals, for example, electroless copper (Cu), electroless nickel (EN or NiP) and immersion gold (IG or Au), i.e. so-called Cu/ENIG. Anti-corrosion of MIDs in harsh environments, such as in contact with human sweat, is a challenge because the three metals have large differences in electrode potential and part of the circuitry is positively polarized during operation. Furthermore, any coating or surface modification applied onto the metal traces must meet other requirements such as good compatibility with soldering and less effect on the surface conductivity. In this study, failure analysis of 3D MID devices working in sweat environment was carried out to understand the corrosion mechanisms. It is shown that EN coating showed better corrosion resistance than Cu substrate, which is attributed to the passivation effect of phosphorus in NiP alloy material. The reasons causing the metal trace corrosion include existence of coating defects in both of Au and EN coatings, poor corrosion resistance of Cu in sweat, and large difference in electrode potential among the three metals. Based on the failure analysis results, a synergetic effect of surface passivation by using self-assembled-monolayer (SAM) of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) and hydrophobic conformal coating was studied. The sweat tests show that a combination of SAM and hydrophobic conformal coating can effectively retard the corrosion progress of Cu substrate of the metal traces on 3D MIDs.
AbstractThe effect of various heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or selenium atoms on the corrosion of type 304SS in 2M sulfuric acid solution was studied by weight loss, gasometry, dc and ac techniques. It was found that the inhibition efficiency of tested compounds follows the order 2-methylbenzoselenazole (2-MBS) > 2-methyl-benzothiazole (2-MBT) > 2-methylbenzoxazole (2-MBO) > 2-methylbenzimidazole (2-MBI); the adsorption isotherms follow the Frumkin isotherm and the thermodynamic/kinetic model. Polarization curves showed that these compounds acted by decreasing the available surface area with no change in reaction mechanism. The stability of the formed film was verified by the AC impedance technique.
AbstractThe inhibition efficiency of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (EMID) was studied against mild steel corrosion, in acidic environment. Surface analysis showed that the assembled inhibitor film could protect the metal successfully, during 120 h exposure to 0.1 M H2SO4. The studies considering zero charge potential value (Epzc) showed that the anion plays the major role for film formation. The surface coverage ratio (θ) values were determined handling the double layer capacitance values (Cdl) calculated from Bode diagrams, for different concentration and temperature conditions. The inhibitor was fixed successfully within polypyrrole film and applied to steel surface as highly protective coating.Highlights► Inhibition efficiency of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide. ► Highly stable inhibitor film is assembled on steel. ► Excellent efficiency for 120 h exposure in acidic media. ► This compound could be successfully fixed within polypyrrole coating. ► The protection efficiency of polymer film is improved.
Highlights•The zinc doped polyaniline was grafted on the graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets.•The anti-corrosion properties of GO-PAni-Zn/epoxy composite were examined.•GO-PAni-Zn remarkably improved the epoxy coating barrier/active inhibition performance.AbstractBy a layer by layer deposition approach the grafted graphene oxide (GO) particles were grafted by zinc doped polyaniline (PAni) and then distributed in the epoxy matrix to provide active inhibition/barrier properties simultaneously. The modified/unmodified nanosheets were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and Raman spectroscopy. The corrosion prevention effect of GO-PAni-Zn/epoxy composite was studied by EIS and salt spray test. Results revealed that the GO nanosheets dispersion quality and interfacial interactions were improved after applying PAni-Zn layer, leading to significant improvement in the epoxy coating barrier properties against diffusion of sodium chloride solution. In addition, according to EIS test results the active inhibition properties of the epoxy film was promoted after addition of zinc doped polyaniline compound. GIXRD results confirmed deposition of an inhibitor film on metal surface within the scratched part of epoxy composite coating filled with GO-PAni-Zn particles. In addition, the coating surface damage during salt spray test was significantly decreased through addition of GO-PAni-Zn as demonstrated by SEM/contact angle tests.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (333KB)Download full-size image
AbstractPolyaniline (PANI) was covered on the surface of ultra-short glass fibers uniformly by in situ polymerization of aniline. Epoxy coatings with different contents of PANI ultra-short glass fibers and ultra-short glass fibers were formulated and their protection abilities were evaluated by means of open-circuit potential, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and salt spray test.

Highlights•Research towards lead corrosion inhibition using carboxylic acids.•We examine the deposition of a lead dodecanoate coating on a lead sample and test it for corrosion using in-situ 2D SR-XRD.•For comparison we test the corrosion for a bare lead sample.•We could follow the deposition and the breakdown of the coating as a function of potential and time.•We report a clear inhibitive action of the coating.AbstractThis paper concerns a time lapse spectroelectrochemical study of the growth of lead dodecanoate layers on a lead substrate in an aqueous solution using cyclic voltammetry. In-situ synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on station BM26A (DUBBLE) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in France. The diffraction pattern images were taken using a two-dimensional Mar CCD camera. After deposition of the coating, a spectroelectrochemical study of a linear sweep voltammetry experiment using an acetic acid electrolyte, simulating ‘active’ lead corrosion, was carried out on both a bare and lead dodecanoate coated sample. The results show that the coating inhibits the formation of new lead corrosion products.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image
