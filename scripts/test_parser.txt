Characterization of volatile organic compound emissions from consumer level material extrusion 3D printers - ScienceDirect
Highlights•3D printing is a source of numerous VOCs, 216 chemicals detected.•Many VOCs detected are irritants with carcinogenic/reproductive toxicity potentials.•Emissions can be affected by 3D printing conditions and filament parameters.•Test and measurement methods impact predicted exposure concentration.•Predicted concentrations suggest users minimize direct exposure to 3D printing.AbstractFused filament fabrication (FFF) printers, the most common type of office, educational, and consumer-level 3D printers, emit complex mixture of volatile gases and ultrafine particles (UFPs) that can deteriorate indoor air quality (IAQ). It is important to understand their potential health risks as the technology becomes more prevalent. The developed method for characterizing and quantifying emissions from an operating FFF 3D printer measures particulate and volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations over time using an environment controlled testing chamber. Characterization of 3D printer emissions is critical for understanding the chemical safety of this technology for providing guidance to minimize exposure to unintentional hazardous emissions.This study found 3D printers to be a source of numerous VOCs and particles that can be released into the indoor air with 216 individual VOCs identified. These VOCs were assessed for their indoor air and human exposure impact. The specific VOCs released during printing varied depending on the filament material. Filament monomers and degradation byproducts were identified in air samples. Total VOC emissions ranged from 147 μg h−1 for polyvinyl alcohol filament to 1660 μg h−1 for nylon filament. Nozzle temperature, filament material, filament brand, printer brand, and filament color all affected VOC and particle emissions. Personal exposure levels and room exposure levels in two indoor situations, a bedroom and a classroom, were predicted for certain VOCs known or suspected to be carcinogens or irritants. Some chemicals of concern exceeded recommended indoor levels linked to adverse health effects. Exposure levels could be minimized by operating verified low-emitting 3D printers and filaments, reducing the printer nozzle temperature when possible, increasing ventilation around the printer, and providing local exhaust.
1. Introduction3D printers are used in various applications, such as development of prototypes, constructing industrial and medical parts and components, for science, technology and engineering educational applications, and consumers. Fused filament fabrication (FFF) works by heating a coil of thermoplastic filament and extruding the filament from a nozzle onto a moving platform, building the object layer by layer. Numerous filaments are available for FFF and are usually a blend of thermoplastics (e.g., polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), nylon, and polycarbonate (PC)) often mixed with coloring dye, metal, wood, plant, and other additives. These thermoplastics are typically heated in the range of 180 °C–270 °C but can be as high as 500 °C. This heating process has been found to result in emissions of volatile gases and ultrafine particles (UFPs) that deteriorate indoor air quality (IAQ) [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]. Emissions from 3D printers can be released over a long period of time since the 3D printers are typically operated indoors for hours. Both acute and chronic exposure may occur to users and occupants in the surrounding space.Previous studies have found that gas phase emissions from 3D printers are complex and contain a mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which may include odorants, irritants, and carcinogens [[1], [2], [3], [4],6]. Commonly detected individual VOCs from 3D printing included styrene [[1], [2], [3], [4],9,10], lactide [2,4,9], caprolactam [2,4], ethylbenzene [[1], [2], [3], [4],6], xylenes [1,2,4,6], and aldehydes [1,4,6]. Monomers or derivatives of filament material were the speciated VOCs commonly detected [[2], [3], [4]]. However, previous studies reported a limited number of VOCs, around 30 species, from 3D printing using ABS, PLA, and nylon filaments. Generally, ABS was found to release more total VOC than PLA [[1], [2], [3], [4],6,7]. However, when filaments include additives like bronze and nanotubes, VOC emissions may increase [4] or decrease [10]. Filament properties as well as 3D printer operating parameters have been shown to affect VOC emissions [1,2], however their findings were not consistent. With the complexity of 3D printing emissions and plethora of 3D printer and filament options in the marketplace, it is critical to be able to characterize 3D printing emissions consistently and accurately. This can be done using a defined test method so that comparative data can be obtained, and assessments can be made to minimize unwanted exposures to hazardous emissions. The experimental setup (i.e. test environment and exposure methods) and VOC analysis techniques varied among previous studies. VOC emissions from 3D printing have been identified via various environmental chamber methods [[1], [2], [3], [4],6,7], field measurements [3,7], and direct desorption of materials to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-SM) [9,10], making it difficult to compare data between studies and with other emissions resources.This paper characterizes 3D printer emissions among various printers and media using a standardized environmental chamber methodology typically used for product emission testing [11]. We identified a broader range of VOCs from 3D printing including VOCs with potential health concern that have not been reported previously due to measurement limitations. This study investigated VOC emissions from 25 different 3D printer/filament combinations coupled with exposure modeling. Systematically designed experiments on the effect of print condition parameters were carried out, including parameters not yet studied such as printer brand, filament brand, and the use of an internal air filter. The obtained emissions data were compared with those of other electronics and previously published 3D printer emission factors. Furthermore, the relationships between VOCs released during printing and filament only VOCs are discussed as well as the relationship between VOC and UFP emissions. With a better understanding of the emission levels from the consumer-level 3D printers tested, this study provides insight into evaluating potential health concerns using an exposure model with personal, residential, and classroom exposure scenarios and illustrates the need to reduce human exposure.2. Materials and methods2.1. 3D printers and filamentsFive commercially available desktop 3D printers from various manufacturers were studied. Twenty different 1.75 mm diameter filaments were studied, with materials ranging from ABS, PLA, nylon, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) from eight different distributors. VOC samples were collected for 25 different print runs (Table 1). Some printers allowed control of the extruder temperature to enable the use of different filament materials. To enhance attachment of extruded materials on a build plate, some 3D printers provided the function of heating the build plate and some others operated it at room temperature but with glue or tape on the surface. Two printers were fully enclosed, one with a built in high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtering system. The others were of open design. All experiments printed the same object, a cube, with the same print quality parameters.Table 1.

Environmental chamberA methodology for characterizing and quantifying UFP and VOC emissions from 3D printers that involves operation inside a controlled environmental chamber has been developed [12] based on an international laser printer certification program [13] and IAQ/product testing programs [14,15]. Each 3D printer was tested in a standardized environmental chamber with electropolished stainless steel interior surfaces (1 m³ in volume) designed for quantifying emissions from a source in a well-mixed, air tight, and clean environment following the guidance of ASTM D6670 [11] (Fig. 1). Air supplied to the chamber was stripped of VOCs and particles so that any contaminant backgrounds present in the empty chamber fell below strict levels (<10 μg m−3 total VOC (TVOC), <1 μg m−3 total particles, < 2 μg m−3 for any individual VOCs). Air supply to the chamber was maintained at a temperature of 23 °C ± 1 °C. Purified air was not controlled for relative humidity, however, relative humidity was continuously monitored inside the chamber and was found to be 3% on average. The air exchange rate was 1 ± 0.05 air change per hour.Download high-res image (679KB)Download full-size imageFig. 1. A picture of the chamber set up with 3D printer elevated to be in the middle of the chamber. The sampling lines are inserted from the sides and the top walls.Filament material specific VOC emissions were also studied by heating the filaments individually. Test samples of the filaments were placed on a microscope glass slide inside a stainless steel box and heated to the nozzle temperature by an external heat source placed underneath the box.2.3. Emission measurementVOC samples were collected directly on Tenax® TA (300 mg) 60/80 mesh sorption tubes and low-molecular-weight aldehydes on solid sorbent cartridges treated with 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) using a mass flow controller. Teflon™ tubing sampling lines were adjusted to extend approximately 10 cm away from the chamber walls and 15 cm from the 3D printer. Chamber background samples were collected for 30 min during the pre-operating phase with the printer and filament loaded in the chamber but not printing. The test sample was collected during the last hour of printing to capture the maximum chamber emissions. Another 1-h sample was taken 2 h after the printing ended for decay analysis. The target air volume collections for 1-h samples were 12 L (collecting at 0.2 lpm) for VOCs and 30 L (collecting at 0.5 lpm) for aldehydes. In addition, online UFP measurements were obtained continuously through the three print phases; details of measurement instrumentations, settings, and calculation methods can be found in Zhang et al. [12].After collection, VOC samples were thermally desorbed and analyzed using GC-MS in an ISO/IEC 17025 [16] accredited laboratory. The analytical methodology of the sorbent collection technique, separation, and detection followed methods in US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) TO-17 [17], ISO 16000–6 [18], and ASTM D6196 [19], applicable to C6–C16 organic chemicals with boiling points ranging from 35 °C to 250 °C.Identification of VOCs was performed by matching their mass spectral characteristics and retention times using a laboratory specific mass spectral database. This database contains approximately 700 VOCs that have been previously found in indoor air and product emissions studies and have been validated by the laboratory for analysis using the laboratory specific systems. Other VOCs not found in this database were identified using mass spectral characteristics of more than 75,000 compounds available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the US EPA, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).The individual VOCs were quantitated using multipoint calibration standards that were available for 77 specific VOCs listed in indoor air guidelines and chemical regulatory programs including the California Department of Public Health Standard Method v1.2–2017 (CDPH SM) [15], California Proposition 65 (Prop 65) [20], California's Chronic Reference Exposure Levels [21], Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Permissible Exposure Limit [22], and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' Threshold Limit Values (ACGIH TLVs®) [23]. The other VOCs without authentic standards were calibrated relative to toluene. TVOC was determined by converting the total GC/MS scan response and calculating a concentration based on a toluene equivalent.Aldehyde samples on DNPH cartridges were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following methods in US EPA TO-11A [24], ISO 16000–3 [25], and ASTM D5197 [26]. The sampled DNPH reagent in the cartridge reacted with collected carbonyl compounds to form derivatives that were eluted with acetonitrile. Analysis was done using reverse-phase HPLC with ultraviolet (UV) detection. Multipoint calibrations were available for the target analytes that included formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 2-propenal, acrolein, propanal, 2-butenal, butanal, benzaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal, pentanal, 2-methylbenzaldehyde, 3- and 4-methylbenzaldehyde, hexanal, and 2,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde.The limit of detection was less than 2 μg m−3, usually ranging from 0.2 μg m−3 to 0.5 μg m−3 for most VOCs and aldehydes, and the limit of quantification was defined as 2 μg m−3 for this study. Sample duplicates were collected at a 25% rate for the air samples collected, and an average uncertainty of 12.3% was measured for reported levels above the quantification limit.For the filament only test, the background sample was collected with only the microscope glass slide heated to the target temperature associated with the nozzle temperature. Once the slide reached the target extrusion temperature, VOCs and aldehydes were sampled for 30 min collecting 6 L and 15 L of background air respectively. When the slide cooled back to room temperature, a measured amount of filament was placed on top of the slide and heated to the same target temperature and air samples collected. Air samples were collected at 0.5 and 1 h time points (from when filament temperature reached the desired temperature) for 30 min and at 2.5 and 4 h time points for 90 min. Only ABS, PLA, and nylon filaments were tested using this method.2.4. Emission rate and yieldEmission rates (ERs) of VOCs and aldehydes were calculated from the measured chamber concentrations using a mass conservation equation derived for an environmental chamber with 1st order decay and negligible adsorption and desorption rates following the data analysis method in ASTM D6670 [11]. The average emission rate of chemical i, ERg,i (μg h−1) was calculated using Equation (1):(1)ERg,i=Q(Cit−Ci0⋅exp(−QV(t−t0)))1−exp(−QV(t−t0))<math><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">E</mi><msub is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">R</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">g</mi><mo is="true">,</mo><mspace width="0.25em" is="true"></mspace><mi is="true">i</mi></mrow></msub><mo linebreak="goodbreak" is="true">=</mo><mfrac is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">Q</mi><mrow is="true"><mo stretchy="true" is="true">(</mo><msub is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">C</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">i</mi><mi is="true">t</mi></mrow></msub><mo linebreak="badbreak" is="true">−</mo><msub is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">C</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">i</mi><mn is="true">0</mn></mrow></msub><mo linebreak="badbreak" is="true">⋅</mo><mi is="true">exp</mi><mrow is="true"><mo stretchy="true" is="true">(</mo><mrow is="true"><mo is="true">−</mo><mfrac is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">Q</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">V</mi></mrow></mfrac><mrow is="true"><mo stretchy="true" is="true">(</mo><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">t</mi><mo linebreak="badbreak" is="true">−</mo><msub is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">t</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mn is="true">0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy="true" is="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="true" is="true">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy="true" is="true">)</mo></mrow><mrow is="true"><mn is="true">1</mn><mo linebreak="badbreak" is="true">−</mo><mi is="true">e</mi><mi is="true">x</mi><mi is="true">p</mi><mrow is="true"><mo stretchy="true" is="true">(</mo><mrow is="true"><mo is="true">−</mo><mfrac is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">Q</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">V</mi></mrow></mfrac><mrow is="true"><mo stretchy="true" is="true">(</mo><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">t</mi><mo linebreak="badbreak" is="true">−</mo><msub is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">t</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mn is="true">0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy="true" is="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="true" is="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>where Q (m3 h−1) is the measured air flow rate into the chamber, Cit (μg m−3) is the chamber concentration of a target VOCi measured at time t which is the midpoint of the sampling period, Ci0 (μg m−3) is the chamber background concentration measured without a printer operating, t and t0 are the time points corresponding to the concentrations. V is the volume inside the chamber.Emission yield was also calculated to relate emissions to physically how much filament was consumed. Emission rate and emission yield could be converted according to extrusion rate.

Predicted exposure modelingA single room exposure model was used to estimate potential inhalation exposure concentrations for users and building occupants based on measured chamber concentrations and calculated emission rates. Exposure concentrations were predicted for personal space, a residential room, and a classroom. The modeling method and room parameters were obtained from the primary IAQ guideline for testing and assessing VOC source emissions [15]. Details on the exposure estimates are provided in the following sections so the users can assess the applicability of the estimates to their situation.Personal exposure concentration was assumed to be the direct measured chamber concentration where air samples were drawn within 15 cm away from a single 3D printer. The estimated perimeter room exposure concentrations were calculated for a residential room and a classroom based on a steady state mass balance model. Assumptions were that emissions were well-mixed within the modeled rooms. The estimated exposure concentration, Ci,m (μg m−3), of a target emission, i, for a particular room model, m, was derived using Equation (3).(3)Ci,m=ERg,i(AVm)(1Nm)<math><mrow is="true"><msub is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">C</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">i</mi><mo is="true">,</mo><mi is="true">m</mi></mrow></msub><mo linebreak="goodbreak" is="true">=</mo><mi is="true">E</mi><msub is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">R</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">g</mi><mo is="true">,</mo><mi is="true">i</mi></mrow></msub><mspace width="0.25em" is="true"></mspace><mrow is="true"><mo stretchy="true" is="true">(</mo><mrow is="true"><mfrac is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">A</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><msub is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">V</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">m</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy="true" is="true">)</mo></mrow><mrow is="true"><mo stretchy="true" is="true">(</mo><mrow is="true"><mfrac is="true"><mrow is="true"><mn is="true">1</mn></mrow><mrow is="true"><msub is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">N</mi></mrow><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">m</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy="true" is="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>A is the number of printers in the modeled room, Vm (m3) is the volume of the modeled room and Nm (h−1) is the air exchange rate of the modeled room. A, Vm, and Nm are specific to the two scenarios.The model for a residential room was based on a single-family residence described by CDPH SM [15]. This single-family residence was based on data from the 2008 DOE Buildings Energy Data Book [27] that summarized statistics collected by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). The CDPH SM home descriptions are presented in ANSI/CAN/UL 2904 (UL 2904) [28] as a four bedroom, two bath residence with a floor space area of 211 m2 and a simple total volume (floor space area times ceiling height) of 547 m3. The outdoor air change rate of 0.23 h−1 from CDPH SM [15] was used and represents an energy efficient home. A bedroom/hobby room with a volume of 28.2 m3 was used as the residential exposure room.The classroom parameters, also obtained from CDPH SM [15], had a volume of 231 m3 and outdoor air change rate of 0.82 h−1. It was assumed that three 3D printers were operating in the classroom since most schools that own 3D printers have two to five 3D printers [29].Predicted exposure concentrations were made with the following assumptions: air within open areas of the indoor environment was well-mixed at the breathing level zone of the occupied space; environmental conditions were similar to those inside the 1 m3 chamber; there were no additional sources of the target pollutants; and there were no sinks or potential re-emitting sources within the space for the pollutants. The assumption was also made that emissions were not interacting with any pre-existing air pollutants since the chamber tests were done under clean conditions. The relative humidity inside the chamber may not reflect what occurs in a real-life environment.3. Results3.1. Total VOCTo understand the significance of 3D printer emissions compared to other common electronics, the 3D printer TVOC ERs by filament material were compared to those from laser printers, copiers, and computers (Table 2). The electronic emissions data was also obtained using a controlled environmental chamber and chemical analysis as described in this study [30]. The TVOC ERs from 3D printing on average were lower than those from laser printers and dry process copiers, in agreement with Stefaniak et al. [1]. However, some of the high emitting filaments like ABS and nylon had similar TVOC ERs as lower-emitting laser printers and personal computers.Table 2.

[31].TVOC ERs varied by filament material. ABS filaments generated 4.3 times higher TVOC ER than PLA. TVOC ERs of HIPS and ABS were similar (888 μg h−1 and 835 μg h−1 respectively), and those of PVA and PLA were also comparable at a much lower level (147 μg h−1 and 193 μg h−1). The two tests with nylon filaments varied significantly, with one emitting 11 times more TVOC than the other nylon brand; this high emitting nylon was the highest emitting 3D printer filament in this study. TVOC emission yields, normalized to the mass of filament material extruded rather than time, also showed similar differences by filament material (Table A1).3.2. Individual VOCsA total of 216 individual VOCs was identified in the air samples collected from the 3D printer chamber experiments. ABS had the most detected with 177 individual VOCs, followed by 70 compounds from HIPS, 57 compounds from PLA, 49 compounds from PVA, and 47 compounds from nylon (all individual VOCs detected from ABS, PLA, and nylon are listed in Appendix B). ERs and detection frequencies for the top 15 individual VOCs from each filament material are listed in Table 3. Predominant monomers of each filament material were detected due to extrusion nozzle temperatures being higher than their boiling points (styrene: 145 °C, lactide: 142 °C, caprolactam: 270 °C). Caprolactam from nylon filament had the largest average ER (1749 μg h−1), followed by styrene from ABS (276 μg h−1) and HIPS (281 μg h−1), and acetic acid from PVA (184 μg h−1). The average ER of lactide from PLA (111 μg h−1) was less than half of the average ER of styrene. Six different nitriles and benzothiazole, which are chemicals with nitrogen like acrylonitrile, and ethylbenzene which is used in the production of styrene were also released from ABS.

Common thermal degradation byproducts of filament monomers, such as benzenes, toluene, xylenes, hydrocarbons, and aldehydes, were detected. The HIPS ER for styrene was also in the range of ABS values. Special PLA had a similar lactide ER as other PLAs; however, it had a higher TVOC ER, which could be from the specific additives. VOCs that were specific to Special PLA included cyclododecane, and benzenes and phenol with aromatic rings (2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-phenol, 1-(1-methylethenyl)-3-(1-methylethyl) benzene, 1-[4-(1-methylethyl)phenyl]-ethanone, 1,3-diisopropyl benzene, and à-methyl-3-(1-methylethyl) benzeneethanol). These indicate the potential presence of additive materials like polycarbonate with aromatic rings.Out of hundreds of VOCs identified, only 5 (for PLA) to 8 VOCs (for ABS) were consistently detected for each filament material. The inconsistency in the rest of the VOC identifications may be due to the wide range of chemical formulations currently available for 3D printer filaments.Out of the top 15 individual VOCs emitted (Table 3), 13 VOCs for ABS, 13 for PLA, 13 for nylon, 11 for HIPS, and 14 for PVA are known to have toxic, irritant, and/or odorant properties. These chemicals of concern are discussed in Section 4.2. The emissions from the heated filament studies (without the use of 3D printers) confirmed that the bulk of the VOCs identified from the filaments matched the individual VOC emission profiles during printing (Fig. 2). The top five VOCs from the filament-only tests were found in 3D printing tests as well, and these VOCs made up at least 60% of TVOC. In some cases, monomers for previously printed filaments were re-released and was detected in addition to those from the filament being tested. Fig. 2 also shows that emissions data from filament only testing cannot be quantitatively correlated to emissions released during actual printing as the ratios of the individual VOCs do not match between filament only and actual printing tests.Download high-res image (197KB)Download full-size imageFig. 2. VOC composition for filament only test (F) versus filament and printer (1 m3 chamber test) (F + P) for a specific filament selected for each filament type. Note, F + P only shows one filament brand, there may be large differences between filament brands.TVOC (Table 2) and the top emitting individual VOC ERs (Table 3) from this study are compared to other published values in Fig. 3. These studies overall consistently showed that caprolactam made up the bulk of TVOC from nylon filaments and top emitting individual VOCs were filament material monomers (styrene from ABS and HIPS, lactide from PLA, and caprolactam from nylon). TVOC ERs were the highest for nylon filaments, followed by ABS, HIPS, and then PLA. ERs from this study were in the lower range of other published values.Download high-res image (242KB)Download full-size imageFig. 3. TVOC (toluene equivalent) and individual VOC (styrene, lactide, and caprolactam) ERs from this study compared to other literature by filament material. Error bars represent standard deviations determined from repeated experiments using the same filament material. 3D printer malfunctioned results in Stefaniak et al. 1 are not included. Only one test with HIPS was performed in the study, therefore sample standard deviation is not available for HIPS.Fig. 3 indicates the need for standardized test and analysis methods to make a case for obtaining comparative VOC data among printers and printer/filament combinations, and accurately predicting exposure concentrations. The maximum reported ERs within filament types differed three to fifteen times larger than the minimum reported ERs. We note that variability in experimental design, measurement method, and exposure modeling can be a cause of variability among studies [32]. For example, lactic acid is known to be released from PLA, however, was not detected since our analysis focused on VOCs greater than C6. TVOC ER for PLA in this study may be lower than the values obtained from other 3D printer studies. A standardized test method could reduce the inaccuracy in emission factors and avoid large discrepancies that could lead to poor predictions of exposure concentrations, lack of confidence in the emissions data, and could even mislead exposure levels and health outcomes. Emission deviations due to 3D printer and filament parameters are discussed next.3.3. Effects of 3D printer and filament parametersThe effects of filament color, filament and printer brands, nozzle temperature, and built-in HEPA filter were investigated regarding VOC emissions. The detailed analysis is in Appendix C and the summary is shown in Table 4. Filament color, printer brand, and filament brand were the top three parameters that directly affected ERs. TVOC and monomers released were all influenced in a similar pattern by printer brand, filament color, and nozzle temperature.Table 4.

The colored pigment and additives in the filaments were also assumed to cause differences in emitted VOC species and their magnitude. Certain VOCs including formaldehyde, other aldehydes, and acetophenone ERs varied significantly by filament brands for both PLA and ABS. Some PLAs emitted methyl methacrylate depending on the manufacturer. Emissions decreased with a decrease in nozzle temperature. Use of a HEPA filter did not decrease VOC ERs but in fact, increased ERs of styrene, hydrocarbons, xylenes, and benzaldehyde, which may have been due to the filter material itself.3.4. Relationship between VOC and particle emissionsBoth detailed UFP [12] and VOC emissions from 3D printing were measured in the study; relationships between the two were analyzed. This study's lower ERs relative to other published values was concurrent with the lower particle ERs that Zhang et al. [12] found. The semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) including additives, which were not measured during the chamber experiments, were potentially forming particles [7,33]. Some VOCs are byproducts of these SVOCs that make up particles, therefore some relationships between VOCs and particles might be observed.Some VOC and particle relationships were notable when separated by filament type (Appendix D). For ABS filament data, an increase in styrene ER was associated with an increase in particle mass ER (with r2 = 0.74, p-value = 0.0003) and in particle number ER (with r2 = 0.40, p-value = 0.03). Benzothiazole had a better ER correlation with particle ERs compared to other individual VOCs (Table D1). For PLA, lactide ER versus total particle mass/number ERs were both positively monotonic (rs, > 0), but strong linear relationships were not observed. Formaldehyde ER and particle mass ER for PLA were well correlated (r2 = 0.79, p-value = 0.003), however, this relationship was driven by three data points that were much higher than the rest of PLA data. Looking at the effect of filament type on ER values, ABS filaments generated 4.3 times higher TVOC ER than PLA's, but this ratio is much lower than ABS to PLA ratio of particle number ERs (138 times larger) and particle mass ERs (58.1 times larger). Relationships between VOC and particles for nylon, special PLA, HIPS, and PVA are discussed in Appendix D.Printer brands influenced both particle and VOC emissions in the same pattern, however, that was not the case for filament color and filament brand. Increase in nozzle temperature had a much greater effect on particle emissions than VOC emissions. While the particle count decreased for the larger particles (e.g. greater than 300 nm in diameters) with the built-in HEPA filter system, smaller UFPs and VOC emissions remained the same or even increased with the use of a filter.4. Discussion4.1. TVOC predicted exposure levelPredicted TVOC concentrations from 3D printing varied by one order of magnitude between a personal space (breathing zone) versus a residential room, and a residential room versus a classroom (Table 5). The average predicted personal TVOC concentration was 645 μg m−3, which is over the TVOC criteria (500 μg m−3) recommended by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design [34] and ANSI/CAN/UL 2904 [28]. The average predicted TVOC concentration for a residential room was lower at 99.3 μg m−3 and even lower for a classroom with three operating prints at 48.3 μg m−3. The predicted personal TVOC concentrations around a 3D printer with ABS and nylon filaments were the highest and predicted to exceed 500 μg m−3, reaching up to 3050 μg m−3 in this study. Numerous building and operating conditions could affect these exposure concentrations including ventilation rates, air mixing, number of printers operating and printer/filament combinations.Table 5. Average and maximum predicted TVOC exposure concentrations for various room environment.

Individual VOC predicted exposure level and health implicationsAll individual VOCs identified were evaluated for their presence across national and international indoor air regulatory and health risk tables. The tables in Appendix B lists all the VOCs detected by filament material along with indications of which health risk table the VOC can be found. Acetaldehyde, ethylbenzene, formaldehyde, methylene chloride, styrene, and toluene were the six VOCs commonly detected in ABS, PLA, and nylon filaments. Formaldehyde is listed as a human carcinogen, styrene and methylene chloride as probable human carcinogens, acetaldehyde and ethylbenzene as possibly human carcinogens under the IARC [35] and Prop 65 [20]. Toluene is listed under Prop 65 for its reproductive and developmental toxicity. These six VOCs are also listed under the ACGIH TLV® [23], Ausschuss zur gesundheitlichen Bewertung von Bauprodukten's Lowest Concentration of Interest (AgBB LCI) [36], and CDPH SM [15]. 51 VOCs (29%) for ABS, 36 VOCs (63%) for PLA, and 30 VOCs (64%) for nylon out of the total number of individual VOCs identified for each filament material were found at least once in the five risk tables mentioned previously. The common thermal degradation byproducts of filaments (benzenes, toluene, xylenes, and aldehydes) are often listed in these health risk tables.Caprolactam is associated with ocular and respiratory toxicity and has a low 8-h chronic reference exposure level (CREL) of 7 μg m−3 (1.4 ppb) [37]. Acetic acid (from PVA) is an irritant and is listed under ACGIH TLV® and AgBB LCI. PLA is the only filament type that does not have its primary detected monomer, lactide, listed under major regulatory/health risk lists for IAQ. However, the VOC with the second highest ER from some PLA filaments, methyl methacrylate, is an irritant [36].For the top emitting VOCs that are hazardous to humans, their predicted exposure concentration levels were compared to three risk tables: CDPH SM, 1/10 ACGIH TLV®, and AgBB ICL (Fig. 4). Typical residential IAQ VOC levels are included in Fig. 4 as background concentrations, and they were obtained from Logue et al. [38] and Offermann et al. [39] if not found in the first reference. Typical classroom IAQ VOC levels are also included in Fig. 4 as background concentrations, and they were obtained from Godwin et al. [40] and Jenkins et al. [41] For ABS, PLA, and nylon respectively, 30 VOCs (59%), 19 VOCs (53%), 14 VOCs (47%) out of all the individual VOCs associated with health effects were introduced from 3D printing at much higher concentrations than typical/background IAQ levels. Caprolactam, acetophenone, 1-butanol, vinyl cyclohexene, and 2-butenal concentrations were elevated from 3D printing.Download high-res image (629KB)Download full-size imageFig. 4. Predicted indoor air concentrations in A: personal space, B: residential room, C: classroom compared to relevant national and international IAQ criteria. Error bar extends to the predicted concentration value using the maximum ER measured. Residential background (BG) concentrations were obtained from Logue et al. [38] and Offermann et al. [39], and classroom background concentrations from Godwin et al. [40] and Jenkins et al. [41].Predicted concentrations of caprolactam, formaldehyde, and benzene, known irritants and/or carcinogens, exceeded some criteria listed above for personal exposure and as well as those of caprolactam and formaldehyde for maximum residential exposure. Caprolactam exposure from 3D printer operating nylon filament could exceed the criteria in AgBB, CREL, and ACGIH (1/10 TLV® TWA). The predicted personal and maximum residential exposure concentrations of formaldehyde could exceed limits set by CDPH SM from 3D printing emission. Benzene emission could be twice the concentration of the CDPH SM's criteria for personal exposure. The maximum predicted residential concentration and the average personal exposure concentration for 2-butenal, a highly reactive aldehyde that may cause inflammation and respiratory and neurotoxic symptoms, exceeded the allowable concentration in AgBB. The maximum styrene (an irritant, a narcotic and neuropathic agent) concentration for personal exposure was above the allowable concentration by AgBB.The maximum predicted personal exposure concentrations of benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde, an irritant and/or carcinogen, exceeded recommended criteria in one of the three risk tables. Other VOCs that might potentially exceed the allowable indoor concentrations in personal breathing zone were 1-butanol, xylenes, toluene, methyl styrene, and ethylbenzene. While none of the chemicals of concern predictions in a classroom with three operating 3D printers exceeded the IAQ criteria, both caprolactam and 2-butenal criteria could be reached if 18 3D printers with nylon filaments were to operate simultaneously in a classroom. Use of a large number of printers can be found in school/university settings [29].4.3. Exposure mitigation methodsThere are a handful of technologies currently available to reduce emissions from 3D printers. A filtering system embedded in the 3D printer tested in this study was not found to be effective in reducing VOC emissions. There are emerging technologies for reducing VOC emissions from 3D printing like installing a photocatalytic filter [42] that could be evaluated. Increasing air exchange/ventilation, increasing air circulation or installing a ventilation hood, or isolation of the emissions source and redirecting the effluent emissions are other methods that may reduce exposure concentrations. However, emission reduction methods that a typical user can apply are limited and may be ineffective on reducing exposure levels especially for VOCs with low allowable concentrations. Controlling the printing parameters that were studied did affect emission levels (maximum TVOC ER difference of 594 μg h−1 for printer brand) but not as much as the differences found between filament types (maximum TVOC ER difference of 2901 μg h−1). Another way to reduce exposure to chemicals of concern from 3D printers may be by reducing/eliminating/replacing known hazardous chemicals from the composition of the raw filaments when possible. 3D printer emissions that are of health concern can also be controlled by setting allowable limits (via a testing and verification standard) and using machines and feedstock that have been tested and verified to have low emissions by third party sources.5. ConclusionThis paper measured a complex mixture of numerous gaseous exposure hazards associated with FFF 3D printing. The ERs of TVOC from 3D printing fell in the range of ERs previously reported for personal computers and laser printers. Over 200 VOCs were identified to be released from 3D printing with the five filament material types studied. Monomers and thermal degradation byproducts unique to specific thermoplastic filaments were released while operating a 3D printer. Over 30 known or suspected irritants and carcinogens were identified in each filament material type. The caprolactam exposure concentration for the studied nylon filament was predicted to be higher than the limits recommended by IAQ guidelines for personal and residential room exposure. The predicted styrene concentrations for personal exposure for some of the higher emitting ABS filament also exceeded IAQ guidelines. Users should also be aware of exposure potentials to aldehydes including formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, vinyl cyclohexene, 2-butenal, and benzene especially when users are next to an operating 3D printer. Therefore, personal and overall building exposure to 3D printer emissions should be minimized.A standardized method to test and assess 3D printer emissions could lead to accurately measuring ERs and assessing the risks. The test data from various 3D printers could be compared, guiding consumers to choose and manufacturers to produce lower emitting 3D printers and filament formulations. 3D printer brand, filament brand, filament color, and nozzle temperature influenced VOC emissions. Some 3D printing conditions affected VOC and UFP emissions differently, therefore both must be considered when selecting a filament that minimizes potential adverse health effects. However, reduction of nozzle temperature or selecting a filament that operates with lower nozzle temperature can reduce exposure to both VOCs and UFPs.Declarations of interestNone.AcknowledgementThis work was supported by Underwriters Laboratories Inc., a not-for-profit organization.Appendices.

Effects of 3D printer and filament parametersAll the parameters except for the ones studied (filament color, filament and printer brands, nozzle temperature, and HEPA filter) were controlled in the following section. The effect of each parameter was investigated regarding VOC emission and particle emissions as well.C.1 Printer BrandTwo cases where the same filament (one case with ABS, another PLA) was used with two different printers were compared. ABS printers (Printer A and E) had one degree difference in nozzle temperatures, which is the printer setting that cannot be changed. Both ABS and PLA chemical emission profiles are similar to one another as expected since the same filament was used for both printers. Printer brand has the largest effect on emission yields (excluding the effect of extrusion rate) and TVOC ERs for both ABS and PLA. For ABS, Printer E emitted twice as much TVOC as Printer A: 593.7 μg h−1 (71%) difference (Figure C1) and 53.6 μg g−1 (84%), and styrene emission is also larger by 86.4 μg h−1 (41%) and 8.8 μg g−1 (55%). Particle emissions, both number and mass, also increased with the use of Printer E. For PLA, Printer A released more particle and gas emissions than Printer C (Figure C1). TVOC emission differed by 56.8 μg h−1 (29%) and 2.6 μg g−1 (16%), and lactide emission differed by 8.7  μg h−1 (8%) and 0.6 μg g−1 (70%),. TVOC, monomers released, and particle emissions were influenced similarly by the difference in printer brands.Download high-res image (261KB)Download full-size imageFigure C.1. Particle number and mass, total volatile organic compound (TVOC), and individual volatile organic compound (lactide, styrene, and caprolactam) emission rates compared per printer brand. ABS on left and PLA on right.C.2 Filament ColorTwo cases, again one for PLA and another for ABS, where different colored filaments by the same manufacture were printed using the same printers and print conditions. Filament color is in the top 3 parameters that directly affect the ERs. The chemical profiles of the emitted monomers from various colored filaments were similar, however the magnitude of the ERs varied. TVOC ERs differed by 522.3 μg h−1 for ABS and by 21.5 μg h−1 for PLA (Figure C2). Styrene ERs from ABS filaments varied by 94.4 μg h−1. Green ABS emitted more than other colors for particle mass, number, and styrene, however not for TVOC. TVOC from red ABS included more VOC species (3-methyl styrene for example was detected from red filament but not for other filaments) and generally had higher ERs of aldehydes. Lactide ERs in PLA filaments differed by 41.3 μg h−1. TVOC, lactide, particle number and mass emissions were consistently higher for white PLA filament. Natural PLA has the lowest ERs, with particle mass emission lower than detect limit and for that reason particle mass for natural is not included in Figure C2. The colored pigment and additives in the filaments are also assumed to cause emission differences.Download high-res image (285KB)Download full-size imageFigure C.2. Particle number and mass, total volatile organic compound (TVOC), and individual volatile organic compound (lactide and styrene) emission rates compared per filament color. ABS on left and PLA on right.C.3 Filament BrandFor the two sets of different brands studied, TVOC ER differences are 438.6 μg h−1 (49%) for ABS and 25.3 μg h−1 (14%) for PLA (Figure C3). Filament brand has a large effect on the filament monomer ERs. Styrene ERs differ by 125.1 μg h−1 (45%) for ABS case and lactide ERs differ by 38.8 μg h−1 (35%). The chemical profiles of the emissions, as well as the magnitude of ERs, vary significantly per filament brand. Especially formaldehyde, other aldehydes, and acetophenone ERs varied significantly by filament brands in both PLA and ABS. Particle number emissions may not follow the same trend of VOC emissions, as particle formation is associated with vapors with low saturation vapor pressures. Brand d is the super emitter in Zhang et al. [6] releasing an order of magnitude higher particle numbers than other ABS filaments studied, but particle mass ER is larger for filament Brand c than Brand d. Particles released from Brand c are much larger than those emitted from Brand d, therefore the particle mass is larger even though particle number is lower for Brand c. For PLA, the particles are inversely related, with higher VOC emitting filament (Brand h) releasing smaller and fewer particles. Emitted particle sizes also differ by filament brands. Some PLAs included methyl methacrylate depending on the manufacture.Download high-res image (282KB)Download full-size imageFigure C.3. Particle number and mass, total volatile organic compound (TVOC), and individual volatile organic compound (lactide and styrene) emission rates compared per filament brand. ABS on left and PLA on right.C.4 Extrusion Nozzle TemperatureThe two comparing nozzle temperatures are 230 °C and 255 °C. Both the VOC and particle emissions increased with higher extrusion temperature. TVOC ER increased by 323.4 μg h−1 (25%) and styrene ER by 80.6 μg h−1 (27%) (Figure C4). Increase in nozzle temperature has a much greater effect on particle emissions (128% increase in particle number and 106% increase in particle mass emissions) than it does for VOC emissions.Download high-res image (196KB)Download full-size imageFigure C.4. Particle number and mass, total volatile organic compound (TVOC), and INDIVIDUAL VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (styrene) emission rates compared per nozzle temperature difference.C.5 Printer with HEPA FilterOne printer was tested once with its built-in HEPA filter system and once without it. While the particle count decreased with HEPA filters for larger particles (e.g. greater than 300 nm in diameters) [6], all other emissions (especially VOC emissions) increased with the use of HEPA filter (Figure C.5). TVOC ER is 18% higher for the scenario with HEPA filter. The case with the filter released higher styrene, hydrocarbons (dodecane, decane, and tetradecane), xylenes, and benzaldehyde. The HEPA filter itself may have contributed to the increase in these VOCs, therefore installation of HEPA filter in this case does not reduce particle or gaseous emissions.Download high-res image (179KB)Download full-size imageFigure C.5. Particle number and mass, total volatile organic compound (TVOC), and individual volatile organic compound (styrene) emission rates compared for a print job with and without HEPA filter installed.D. Relationship between VOC and Particle Emissions for nylon, Special PLA, HIPS, and PVANylon filaments showed an inverse relationship between caprolactam emissions and particle emissions, where the higher VOC emitting nylon filament emitted less particles. However, there were only two nylon tests with significantly varied results, therefore more tests are required to confirm. PLA with additives (Special PLA) had a lactide ER within the range of other PLAs tested, however it emitted much more particles (mass and number), and it also had a relatively larger TVOC ER. This may indicate that emissions from this Special PLA is associated with its additives rather than the bulk material. HIPS data point falls in the range of ABS data points for particle number versus styrene or TVOC but not for particle mass emission. HIPS total particle mass is much higher than that of ABS, also due to larger particle sizes. Emissions from PVA behaved similarly to PLA and lower emitting ABS for both gas and particle emissions.Download high-res image (395KB)Download full-size imageFigure D.1.
