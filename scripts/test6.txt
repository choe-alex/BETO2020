['Laser Fabrication and Spectroscopy of Organic Nanoparticles', ' In working with nanoparticles, researchers still face two fundamental challenges: how to fabricate the nanoparticles with controlled size and shape and how to characterize them. In this Account, we describe recent advances in laser technology both for the synthesis of organic nanoparticles and for their analysis by single nanoparticle spectroscopy.', 'https://doi.org/10.1021/ar800125s']
['Comparing Laser Desorption/Laser Ionization Mass Spectra of Asphaltenes and Model Compounds', 'The molecular-mass distribution of the asphaltene fraction of petroleum is rapidly becoming more constrained, but the molecular architecture remains poorly understood. Two types of molecular structures have been proposed to be representative of asphaltenes: the “island” model and the “archipelago” model. Here, nine compounds were synthesized on the basis of pyrene, representing both types of models. These compounds were analyzed using two-step laser desorption/laser ionization mass spectrometry (L2MS), and the compounds were classified into three groups based on their fragmentation behavior in this typically soft ionization technique. The first two groups, denoted “highly fragmented” and “variably fragmented”, include eight of the nine studied compounds. The masses of fragment ions from the “highly fragmented” group were too small for these specific compounds to dominate the asphaltenes. The fragmentation behavior of the variably fragmented group was inconsistent with L2MS spectra of asphaltene samples; thus, these specific compounds can be excluded from being dominant in asphaltenes. The third group, “highly stable”, contains a single model compound with properties in the aromatics class fraction and exhibits a behavior consistent with previously observed asphaltene samples, namely, inappreciable fragmentation as a function of laser pulse energy used. Although suggestive, no definitive conclusion can be reached as to the dominant molecular architecture of asphaltenes without the study of how more model compounds behave under L2MS.', 'https://doi.org/10.1021/ef100402g']
['Laser Desorption and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry of 29-kDa Au:SR Cluster Compounds', 'Positive and negative ions generated by laser-based ionization methods from three gold:thiolate cluster compounds are mass analyzed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The three compounds have similar inorganic core masses (∼29 kDa, ∼145 Au atoms) but different n-alkanethiolate ligands associated with each cluster compound (Au:SR, R = butane, hexane, dodecane). Irradiation of neat films (laser desorption/ionization) and films generated by dilution of the cluster compounds in an organic acid matrix (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) produced distinct ion abundances that are relevant to different structural aspects of the cluster compound. Laser desorption/ionization of neat Au:SR compound films produces ions consistent with the inorganic core mass (i.e., devoid of original hydrocarbon content). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization produces either ions with m/z values consistent with the core mass of the cluster compounds or ions with m/z values consistent with the approximate molecular weight of the cluster compounds, depending on ionization conditions. The ion abundances, and ionization conditions under which they are detected, provide insight into desorption/ionization processes for these unique cluster compounds as well as other analytes typically studied by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization.

['Laser-Induced Chemistry and Desorption of Organic Monolayers', 'Laser-induced desorption of organic monolayers (LIDOM) is performed to analyze the chemical nature, thermal stability, and fragmentation pattern of organic silicon terminations based on calibration of surface heating introduced with a XeCl laser (308 nm). Results are presented for trimethylsilyl- (TMS) and 1-norbornen-2-yl(ethyl)dimethylsilyl- (NDMS) terminated surfaces which were prepared by silanization with suitable chloro compounds. Depending on laser fluence, either essentially intact end groups are emitted from the surface or specific fragmentation patterns are generated preferentially at higher energy densities. Clean retro Diels−Alder cleavage (rDA) was initiated in a norbonen compound at low fluences (110−200 mJ/cm2), providing reactive surface moieties such as double bonds that can be used as a starting point for controlled secondary surface reactions. At fluences above 200 mJ/cm2 fragmentation of the NDMS group takes place. ', 'https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0708401']
