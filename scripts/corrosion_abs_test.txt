Electrochemical techniques were used to investigate the efficacy of watermelon rind extract (WMRE) as corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in HCl and H2SO4 solutions. The inhibition efficiency increased as the concentration of the extract increases. Potentiodynamic polarization results indicate that WMRE act as a mixed-type inhibitor. The values of effective capacitance obtained by utilizing the impedance parameters in both acidic media are in the range of double layer capacitance. Corrosion inhibition effect of WMRE can be attributed to the adsorption of constituents of WMRE onto the mild steel surface which can be approximated by Temkin adsorption isotherm model.
